\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:Introduction}
This document should be seen as some sort of \ac{NAP} documentation to bridge the gap between the POINT deliverables and the code documentation available through Doxygen \cite{Heesch}.

\section{Installation and Configuration}
The compilation and installation of \ac{MOOSE} has been tested on Debian-based Linux distributions. To compile and install \ac{MOOSE} simply use the make file provisioned with the source code:

\begin{lstlisting}
	~$ cd ~/blackadder/apps/monitoring/server
	~$ make
	~$ sudo make install
\end{lstlisting}

The installation copies a default libconfig-based template configuration file \texttt{moose.cfg} to \texttt{/etc/moose} which is the default location for \ac{MOOSE}. All parameters which are not commented are mandatory and must be provided. The variables of the array \texttt{dataPoints} are optional.
